# Sorcery
Designed a card game in C++ similar to Blizzard's Hearthstone for a Object Oriented Programming class. The code is uploaded in one commit since git version control was not used. The project took 2 weeks to complete.

The game includes design patterns such as observer-subscriber, factory pattern, inheritance, and template.
