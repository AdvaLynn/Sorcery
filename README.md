# Sorcery
In a group of three, we designed a card game in C++ similar to Blizzard's Hearthstone for a Object Oriented Programming class. The code is uploaded in one commit since it was not uploaded until the project was over. The project took 2 weeks to complete.

The game includes design patterns such as observer-subscriber, factory pattern, inheritance, and template.
